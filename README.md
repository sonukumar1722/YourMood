# Music Player 

#### Description
This is a simple music player program implemented in Python using the Tkinter and Pygame libraries. It allows users to create a playlist of their favourite songs and control playback, volume, and song selection. The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can interact with various buttons and controls to manage their music collection.

#### Features
- Add songs to the playlist: Users can add individual songs or select multiple songs at once from their local storage.
- Remove songs from the playlist: Users can remove songs from the playlist if they no longer want them to be included.
- Play, pause, and stop songs: Users can control the playback of songs in the playlist, including pausing and resuming playback and stopping the current song.
- Navigate between songs: Users can switch to the previous or next song in the playlist.
- Adjust volume: Users can change the volume level using a slider control.
- Keyboard controls: The program supports keyboard controls for convenience. Users can use the arrow keys, spacebar, and other shortcuts to perform various actions.

#### Dependencies
The program relies on the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x: The programming language used to develop the application.
- Tkinter: The standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
- Pygame: A Python library for audio playback and mixing.

#### Usage
1. Run the program by executing the Python script in a Python environment.
2. The program's GUI window will appear, showing the playlist, playback controls, and volume slider.
3. To add songs to the playlist, click the "+" button and select one or more audio files (in .mp3 format) from your local storage.
4. To remove a song from the playlist, select it in the playlist and click the "-" button.
5. To play a song, either double-click it in the playlist or select it and click the "‚ñ∂Ô∏è" button.
6. Use the previous "‚èÆÔ∏è" and next "‚è≠Ô∏è" buttons to navigate between songs in the playlist.
7. Adjust the volume using the volume slider "üîä".
8. Keyboard controls are available for convenience. Use the arrow keys, spacebar, and other shortcuts to control playback and volume.
9. To pause a song, click the "‚è∏Ô∏è" button. Click it again to resume playback.
10. Click the "‚èπ" button to stop the currently playing song.

Note: If you have specific songs you want to play, you can also pass their file paths as command-line arguments when running the program. For example:

```
python music_player.py song1.mp3 song2.mp3 song3.mp3
```
